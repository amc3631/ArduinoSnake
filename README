Description:

1. recreate the Snake game in the arduino.
2. including two modes(1 PLAYER MODE & 2 PLAYER MODE)
3. Apply two joystick when excuting the 2 Player mode, both are connected to one
Arduino.
4. Using an array to store the status of the snake and food.
5. Using a structure to store the co-ordinate of the snake.
6. Using a point array to store the track that the snake's head's movement.

Game Rules:

GENERAL
1. When in the menu mode, only the joystick attached with pin A0, A1, and 2
can scroll the menu.
2. Using a joystick to control the direction which the snake move towards.

ONE PLAYER MODE
1. And in the 1 player mode, only this joystick can control the snake.

TWO PLAYER MODE
1. In the 2 player mode, the snake a is the white one, and snake b is the blue
one.
2. The joystick connected to the A0, A1, 2 PIN controls the white snake a.
3. The joystick connected to the A8, A9, 13 PIN controls the blue snake b.
4. The white snake will be initialized at the right bottom corner, and move
towards left.
5. The blue snake will be initialized at the left upper corner, and move towards
right.
6. One of the snakes dies, the game will over, and the snake who longer will win
the game.If the length is same, it will be tie.




Wiring Instruction:
1. wiring the display:

Lite            NOT CONNECTED
Y+              A2 (analog pin)
X+              4  (digital pin)
Y-              5  (digital pin)
X-              A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS             6
CD              NOT CONNECTED

2. Wiring joystick 1:


A1             VRx
A0             VRy
2              SW
GND            GND
5V             5V


2. Wiring joystick 2

A9             VRx
A8             VRy
13             SW
GND            GND
5V             5V

Upload Instructions:
Load it from Arduino IDE and upload from there. Alternatively, use the 'make upload' command in terminal while in the 
directory with the makefile and cpp file.
